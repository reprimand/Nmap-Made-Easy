## Usage

1. **Enter target(s):** Provide the target IP, hostname, or CIDR range.
   - Examples:
     - IP: `192.168.0.1`
     - Hostname: `example.com`
     - CIDR: `192.168.0.0/24`

2. **Select a scan type:** Choose from options like ping scan, service detection, or vulnerability scan.

3. **Choose a timing template (T1â€“T5):** Control scan speed and stealth.
   - T1: Very slow, stealthy.
   - T3: Default, balanced speed.
   - T5: Very fast, less stealthy.

4. **Add optional advanced flags:** Options include OS detection (`--osscan-guess`) or saving results to a file (`-oN results.txt`).

5. **Review and execute the command.** The tool shows the full Nmap command before running, giving you complete control.
